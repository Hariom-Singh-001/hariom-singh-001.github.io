# Zero-Cost Website Starter

This is a single-file website you can deploy **100% free** on GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or Netlify.

## Quick start
1) Open `index.html` and replace **SiteName**, text, and links.
2) Commit and push to a GitHub repo.
3) **Deploy (GitHub Pages)**: Settings ➜ Pages ➜ Source: `main` branch ➜ `/root`. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.
   - Zero cost and automatic HTTPS.
4) Optional: Use the host's default subdomain to keep it free. Custom domains cost money.

## Contact form
- For zero-cost + no backend, embed a Google Form (replace the `<form>` with the embed code).
- Or use a free serverless function (e.g., Cloudflare Workers free tier) to email you.

## Lighthouse
In Chrome DevTools ➜ Lighthouse ➜ Generate report. Fix any red items for performance/SEO.

## License
